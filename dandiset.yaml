description: 'In these recordings, we recorded neuronal activities from cortical-thalamocortical
  (CTC) pathway, including the somatosensory cortex (S1) and posteromedial complex
  (POm) of the thalamus responded to different Pulse Repetition Frequencies (PRFs
  ) or Pulse Durations (PDs) and Pressure Levels of transcranial ultrasound focused
  stimulation (tFUS) using a 128-element transducer to stimulate either at S1or PoM.  Recordings
  for S1 are taken using 64-channel Cambridge or Neuronexus electrodes and recordings
  for POm are taken using 32-channel Nueronexus electrodes. Ultrasound stimulation
  is delivered every 2.5 seconds and each recording has 500 trials. The Ultrasound
  Duration (UD) and pressure level used in each recording is 67ms. The PRFs, PDs and
  pressure levels for each recording can be found in the identifier field. For example,
  in BH596_3000_200_67_10, the PRF is 3000Hz, PD is 200us and pressure level is 10V. '
